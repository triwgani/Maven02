# Maven Market Project - Analyzing Data of a Grocery Chain Firm
## Introduction

![](MavenMarket.png)

This Project Case is part of the Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence Course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop/) online platform by Maven Analytics. In this case, I worked with data from **Maven Market**, a multi-national grocery chain with locations in **Canada, Mexico** and the **United States**. I worked through the entire business intelligence workflow: **connecting and shaping the data, building a relational model, adding calculated fields, and designing an interactive report**.
