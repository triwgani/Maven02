# Maven Market Project - Analyzing Data of a Grocery Chain Firm
## Introduction

![](MavenMarket.png)

This Project Case is part of the Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence Course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop/) online platform by Maven Analytics. In this case, I worked with data from **Maven Market**, a multi-national grocery chain with locations in **Canada, Mexico** and the **United States**. I worked through the entire business intelligence workflow: **connecting and shaping the data, building a relational model, adding calculated fields, and designing an interactive report**.

## Connecting and Shaping the Data

There are several steps in this phase in order to connect and shape the Data used in this case.

**1. Update Power BI options and settings by:** 

- Deselecting the "Autodetect new relationships after data is loaded" option in the Data Load tab
- Making sure that Locale for import is set to "English (United States)" in the Regional Settings tab

**2. Connect to the MavenMarket_Customers csv file by:**

- Naming the table "Customers", and making sure that headers have been promoted
- Confirming that data types are accurate (Note: "customer_id" should be whole numbers, and both "customer_acct_num" and "customer_postal_code" should be text)
- Adding a new column named "full_name" to merge the the "first_name" and "last_name" columns, separated by a space
- Creating a new column named "birth_year" to extract the year from the "birthdate" column, and format as text
- Creating a conditional column named "has_children" which equals "N" if "total_children" = 0, otherwise "Y"

**3. Connect to the MavenMarket_Products csv file by:**

- Naming the table "Products" and making sure that headers have been promoted
- Confirming that data types are accurate (Note: "product_id" should be whole numbers, "product_sku" should be text), "product_retail_price" and "product_cost" should be decimal numbers)
- Using the statistics tools to return the number of distinct product brands, followed by distinct product names and conducting Spot check to see **111 brands and 1,560 product names**
- Adding a calculated column named "discount_price", equal to 90% of the original retail price and formating as a fixed decimal number, and then use the rounding tool to round to 2 digits
- Selecting "product_brand" and use the Group By option to calculate the average retail price by brand, and name the new column "Avg Retail Price". Conducting Spot check to see an average retail price of $2.18 for Washington products, and $2.21 for Green Ribbon
- Deleting the last applied step to return the table to its pre-grouped state
- Replacing "null" values with zeros in both the "recyclable" and "low-fat" columns

**4. Connect to the MavenMarket_Stores csv file by:**

- Naming the table "Stores" and making sure that headers have been promoted
- Confirming that data types are accurate (Note: "store_id" and "region_id" should be whole numbers)
- Adding a calculated column named "full_address", by merging "store_city", "store_state", and "store_country", separated by a comma and space (hint: use a custom separator)
- Adding a calculated column named "area_code", by extracting the characters before the dash ("-") in the "store_phone" field 

**5. Connect to the MavenMarket_Regions csv file by:**

- Naming the table "Regions" and making sure that headers have been promoted
- Confirming that data types are accurate (Note: "region_id" should be whole numbers)

**6. Connect to the MavenMarket_Calendar csv file by:**

- Naming the table "Calendar" and making sure that headers have been promoted
- Using the date tools in the query editor to add the following columns:
    > Start of Week (starting Sunday, Name of Day, Start of Month, Name of Month, Quarter of Year, Year

**7. Connect to the MavenMarket_Returns csv file by:**

- Naming the table "Return_Data" and making sure that headers have been promoted
- Confirming that data types are accurate (all ID columns and quantity should be whole numbers)

**8. Add a new folder on your desktop (or in your documents) named "MavenMarket Transactions", containing both the MavenMarket_Transactions_1997 and MavenMarket_Transactions_1998 csv files by:**

- Connecting to the folder path, and choosing "Edit" (vs. Combine and Edit)
- Clicking the "Content" column header (double arrow icon) to combine the files, then removing the "Source.Name" column
- Naming the table "Transaction_Data", and confirming that headers have been promoted
- Confirming that data types are accurate (all ID columns and quantity should be whole numbers) and conducting Spot check to see data from 1/1/1997 through 12/30/1998 in the "transaction_date" column

**9. With the exception of the two data tables, disable "Include in Report Refresh", then Close & Apply by:**

- Confirming that all 7 tables are now accessible within both the RELATIONSHIPS view and the DATA view
